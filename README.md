# CS205_Uno_Final_Team_6
This project is the game of UNO. In order to start the program, run game.py.
There will then be a menu of options to choose from which include starting a new game,
displaying the rules of the game, and quiting the game. When starting a new game,the program
will prompt the user to enter their name and then play will begin. The user plays
first, followed by the three CPUs. The user will then be able to see the current card
on the top of the deck, their hand of cards, and the three CPU decks. To play a card, the player 
will click on their intended card or the deck and confirm the card. If it is valid, it will end 
their turn and allow the CPUs to go. The game will automatically end whenone of the four players 
plays all of the cards in their hand. Whoever plays their last card first, wins!
