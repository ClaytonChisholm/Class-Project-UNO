# CS205_Uno_Final_Team_6
This project is the game of UNO. In order to start the program, run game.py.
There will then be a list of options to choose from which include starting a new game,
displaying the rules of the game, and quiting the game. When starting a new game,the program
will prompt the user to enter their name and then play will begin. The user plays
first, followed by the three CPUs. The user will then be able to see the current card
on the top of the deck, their hand of cards, and the three CPU's and how many cards
each have left in their hands. To play a card, enter P and enter the card number associated
with the card selected. If the user cannot play a card, enter D to draw from the top of the
deck. If the card is playable, the program will ask the user if they would like to play their
card. Otherwise, the CPU's will then take their turns. The game will automatically end when
one of the four players plays all of the cards in their hand. Whoever plays their last card
first, wins!
